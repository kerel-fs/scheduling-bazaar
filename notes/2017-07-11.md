in filters-notebook.ipynb:
- datetime.datetime.timestamp is much bigger than I thought (which in hindsight makes sense)
- July 11, 2017 about 11:00 am --> 1499789151.60831

finished file filters.py
- pep8 compliant
- includes: passes_per_gs(), passes_per_sat(), passes_gs_sat()

in analysis-notebook.ipynb:
- will use first pass start as start time and last pass end as end time
