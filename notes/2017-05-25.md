**PyEphem leaning day one**

- started with notebook tutorials

https://plot.ly/python/ipython-notebook-tutorial/

https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook#gs.7ZVBT=4

**_Useful Commands_**

".compute" will set a wide range of attributes using a specified date. EX: uranus.compute(1781/3/13) 

".ra" = right asscension in hours of arc around the celestial equator

".dec" = declination in degrees north of the equator

_On artificial satellites:_

Geographic point beneath satellite:
- sublat — Latitude (+N)
- sublong — Longitude (+E)

elevation — Height above sea level (m)

range — Distance from observer to satellite (m)

range_velocity — Range rate of change (m/s)

eclipsed — Whether satellite is in Earth’s shadow

- To interpret a line in XEphem format, call the readdb() function
- To export a body in XEphem format, call the writedb() method of the body itself

I read an article on XEphem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XEphem which lead me to and article about ephemeris: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephemeris

<u>Three difference coordiate classes in PyEphem:</u>
- Equatorial
        ra — right ascension
        dec — declination
        epoch — epoch of the coordinate
- Ecliptic
        lon — ecliptic longitude (+E)
        lat — ecliptic latitude (+N)
        epoch — epoch of the coordinate
- Galactic
        lon — galactic longitude (+E)
        lat — galactic latitude (+N)
        epoch — epoch of the coordinate


**Reading The Cathedral and the Bazaar**

"smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around"

"To make the bazaar model work, it helps enormously if you have at least a little skill at charming people." 

I now understand the naming of this project, and I think it is really fitting. Good read.
