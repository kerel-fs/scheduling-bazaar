Questions to answer:
        - do passes overlap
        - how many sats can the gs see at any given time
        - gaps where GS has no overhead sats
        - avg time/day GS sees a sat "access time"
            - specific sat
            - any sat
            - 30 or 90 day average
            - want to compute capacity of network and GS
                - from "Assessing the Capacity..." C_N and C_j
                - recreate figure 4 plot: "Figure 4 compares the daily access time for the Dnepr-launched Cubesat and the three AFSCN stations."
                - recreate figure 6 plot: "The intersatellite separation affects ground station capacity as shown in Figure 6. The dotted lines are the contact periods for an individual satellite to the ground station. The solid line represents the total daily capacity from a single P-POD of satellites."
        - which sats should be prioritized
            - downlink time?
        
        
For: Do passes overlap?
    - add key to dictionary called conflicts?
        - value of key a list of conflicts containing start, duration, and conflicting sat's name
    - need to compare start time and duration for each pass of each sat
        - python datetime objects should be able to do this?
