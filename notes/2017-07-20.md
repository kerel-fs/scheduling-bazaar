Spent morning working on abstract:
        - "The overall goal of the project is to provide a multi-network ground station scheduling standard and optimize available communication time between spacecraft and receivers. A critical component in this effort is the creation of an automated scheduling system to increase access times (sec/day of potential communication) for low earth orbiting satellites, due to the recent increase in small satellite launches. To fill this gap for the free software community, the Python programming language was used to construct a open-sourced simulator in several phases. Phase one was to understand orbital parameters of low earth orbiting satellites and used PyEphem to do the astronomical calculations necessary to find the passes overhead of certain ground stations. Once the passes had been calculated, phase two involved taking passes and analyzing multiple parameters, such as access time and gaps in satellite coverage. Phase three will involve evaluating different strategies through simulation to determine the most effective scheduling implementation. This research has resulted in the development of a pass finding simulator and has provided analysis of current satellite - ground station communication. Future work after phase three includes optimization of scheduling for independent ground station observations, simulation of ground station - network interaction, and supporting multiple federated ground station networks."

This is the first draft ^
