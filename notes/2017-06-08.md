played around in github to get more familiar with work flow

from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3849509/how-to-remove-n-from-a-list-element
```python
# to remove newline character
def chomp(s):
    return s[:-1] if s.endswith('\n') else s
```
from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/845058/how-to-get-line-count-cheaply-in-python
```python
# to get length of the file
def file_len(fname):
    """Return lengths of file"""
    with open(fname) as f:
        for i, l in enumerate(f):
            pass
    return i + 1
```
worked in notebook called tle-requests-practice

stated new notebook called request-tle-get-passes to try and put it all together in one place.
