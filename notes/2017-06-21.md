after running overnight, came back this morning to pickle data first thing
- cocalc restarted notebook in the process and I have to rerun it 

Reran notebook
- took 12400.152 seconds
    - about 12s per pair
- yeilded 1036 tuple keys in the dict
    - 74 sats x 14 gs
    

_to do_
---
- update get_gs() from suggestion in slack
- wrap current code with contacts function
- find out how long get_passes() takes
