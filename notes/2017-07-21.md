goal: recreate previous plots using a dictionary of clients
- added calender_begin and calendar_end to BaseClient
- used random.sample() to get several different busy_time()'s
- added daily_busy_time() which returns a list of daily totals using busy_time()
- I changed plot_access_time to plot_busy_time() in analysis.py
    - changed gs variable to client
