Working on simulate.py and schedulers.py simultaneously
- see committed changes for what was changed
- middle of the afternoon: simulate.py and schedulers.py now correctly replicate test_client.py
- there is feature `debug=boolean` to control printing stars (*) and dots (.) for scheduled and rejected passes.

schedulers.py includes two non-scheduler functions that are used within schedulers
- pass2request() --> used in each scheduler
- load_sat_dict() --> used in pass2request()

began work on standard analysis
- added standard_analysis() function
- added client_results() function
* having trouble with client_results() and calling client.busy_time()
    - error says str has no method .busy_time()
    - client should not be str, should be entire object
