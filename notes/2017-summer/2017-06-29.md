Began working with interval tree in overlap-function-test.ipynb

added horizon to get_passes() in schedulingbazaar.py
- default is 0
- option to be explicitly stated in function call

_- should not change data from previously pickled data, but should still be rerun using new horizon default._

intervaltree:
- needs begin and end to be integers
- currently get_passes() "stores" start and end times as datetime.ctime() strings
    - intervaltree doesn't like this
- tried callling several datetime opperations on the string, but nothing worked because it doesn't recognize the datetime object
- datetime.timestamp() will return a float to be used for comparisons

horizon successfully added to get_passes(), calc_access_time(), and plot_access_time()
- must be formatted as a string

end of day: started a new run of get_passes() on all combinations. Hopefully it works when I get here tomorrow!
