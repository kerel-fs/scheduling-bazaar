_to do_ 
---
- get_gs() function updates
    - json request from satnogs? <-- low priority
- get_tle() updates? 
    - switch to json? <-- low priority
- overlap function
    - perhaps, return a time range where an overlap occurs (maybe as a key in a dict) and then the pass info for the conflicts in the range (maybe as the value in a dict). My thinking is that then we can take the pass data and use some metric to pick the best one later

* rename `get_gs()` and `get_tle()` to `load_*()` and change the references to the functions


better idea: instantiate conflict objects for each conflict present?

- working on getting a list of all passes for one ground station
- interval tree?
