Worked on getting presentation ready for tomorrow
- focus on the fact that no previous simulator exists

Worked on plotting access time to include in presentation
- currently manually changing axes based on specific type of plot
- will try to automate with next rewrite
- want to show on gs, one sat, and one gs/sat combo
