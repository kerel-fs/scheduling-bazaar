Spent morning going over presentation
- changed around some slides
- added big picture graphic to visually show where we are

Presentation went well!
- got questions on:
    - why only 10 min 3x/day for sat visibility
    - use endtime scheduling
    - type of data that sats are collecting
- maybe try to include these answers next time?

Afternoon:
- work with AllClient
- rework calc_access_time to ask db for busy time
- work on abstract for poster (due Mon)
