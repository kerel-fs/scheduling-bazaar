Interval Tree bug: fails to accurately remove some intervals
- will try/except and see if that works
- found workaround for now
- will start to generate access time for several combinations

Next analysis functions to make:
- %busy time for individual GS /day
- %access time for a sat /day
- For a GS over 1 day, plot labeled line segments showing which Sat it is listening to at any given time
- Same for an individual Sat.  For a day, plot segments showing which GSs are listening at each moment.
