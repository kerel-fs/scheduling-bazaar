/* Schema to describe a **request** object.

This is addressed to a certain Client and is a preliminary Job to become scheduled.  The Network first makes a request to a client with all information needed to execute the job.  To the Job data, it adds a **bounty** (or other name) that indicates the priority of this job or the "payment" to the client if the job's observation is successfully uploaded to the Network.
